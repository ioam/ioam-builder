# Script to start and stop a digital ocean slave node for the holoviews
# buildbot.
#
# USAGE:
#
# ./run_buildbot_slave.sh
#
# This will start the slave and hang. The slave will be shutdown and
# deleted when the script exits (use Ctrl+C).
#
# Requires the TOKEN to be set. Developers can log into
# holoviews@gmail.com and look for the e-mail 'DIGITAL OCEAN TOKEN' and
# anyone else using this script can contact us on Gitter to request one:
#
# https://gitter.im/ioam/holoviews
